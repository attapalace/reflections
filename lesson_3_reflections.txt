When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when i work in a team i may want to share my work with others , or if i want to edit my code from different devices.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

clone is a way of copying a code from remote as GitHub or from another local computer , while fork is like clone but i do it in GitHub to copy someone's code to my account so i can make changes to it without affecting the original code, but branches is a way to create a copy of my code in my local computer so i can make a second version of an app with different language or so.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

this will help to avoid conflicting between local and remote codes because in large codes it will be hard
to fix a conflict.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

i would collaborate using GitHub by creating pull request after i make a new branch with the changes on Git
and push my changes to GitHub asking my partners to see and review my code, this way is much easier than 
using only Git.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

i would want to make changes in a separate branch if i want to make an experimental change or making a 
different version from the master branch , it allows me to make changes safely without any effect on the main code ,espically when i work on GitHub with other Collaporators, but if i just want to fix a bug or 
make an improved version working on master branch would be easier.
