1-What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

At first  an empty git repository is initialized (git init) without any commits ,so i can create my own commit at a certain point, after that we show status by(git status) ,we use (git add) to add track files).

2-How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area is a place where we add files to be tracked before making a commit , i think it is of great value because we may delete files from tracked files or add new files and then we make a commit when we are ready .

3-How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

after making a change to a file in the working directory i write (git add) to the file to go to the staging area , then after (git status) it writes there have been changes added so after i write (git commit) i write a commit message by the editor ,if there are any changes not added and i want to delete them i write ( git reset --hard) to delete those changes , to compare between working directory and staging area (git diff) with no arguments , and (git diff --staged) to compare staging area and recent commit .

4-What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches are helpful when i want to make a different version of an application like different language or easier mode or to test an experimental feature , it will make a new branch as the master branch with the same code ,so any changes i make will affect only this branch.

5-How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

the diagram helps me to know the parent of any commit and if any two commits are related , it also shows me if a commit belongs to a certain branch.

6-What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

when we merge two branches we put all their commits in the master branch ,and they will be distributed by their date by(git merge master branch-two) and then we delete the branch label (git branch -d branch-two),
we represent it in a way to show the parent of each commit and to see how they are related and to see how was the original file and changes proceded

7-What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

Git's automatic merging will make a conflict when the two branches would have similar code with different values ,while it shows me where the conflict is so i can modify it manually .
