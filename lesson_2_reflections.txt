What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

At first  an empty git repository is initialized (git init) without any commits ,so i can create my own commit at a certain point, after that we show status by(git status) ,we use (git add) to add track files).

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area is a place where we add files to be tracked before making a commit , i think it is of great value because we may delete files from tracked files or add new files and then we make a commit when we are ready .
